I spearheaded the development of a fully 
functional Medical LIMS website, showcasing my proficiency in front-end
technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and responsive
user interface. In addition, I implemented a robust PHP back-end to ensure secure
database interactions, prioritizing data integrity and user confidentiality. 
Collaborating seamlessly within a team, we met project milestones and collectively
delivered a high-quality product. Committed to excellence, I conducted thorough testing and
debugging processes to optimize performance, ensuring the seamless functionality and reliability of the website.
